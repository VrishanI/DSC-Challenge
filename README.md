# DSC-Challenge

Developed and implemented binary and multiclass (5 classes) classification models on heartbeat data using logistic regression which had lower accuracy while other models like XGBoost, and Random Forest Classifier reached around a 98 percent accuracy for both classification tasks. Analyzed ECG data to reconstruct high-resolution electro-anatomical maps of the heart.
• Created a Python script for processing and sorting large datasets in numpy arrays to split testing and training data. Developed a random forest model and an MLP regressor to predict activation times based on 12-lead ECG data, correlated with data from 75 distinct regions of the heart.
• Leveraged TensorFlow to design a neural network model for predicting detailed heart trends from 12-lead ECG data. Models such as k-nearest neighbors outperformed the neural network in accuracy and predictive power.
